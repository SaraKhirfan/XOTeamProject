                    <p>Space radiation is ionizing radiation that can damage cellular DNA and biomolecules. It consists of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs): High-energy protons and heavy ions originating outside the solar system, capable of penetrating shielding and causing complex DNA damage.</li>
                        <li>Solar Particle Events (SPEs): High-flux bursts of protons and electrons from solar flares, leading to acute radiation exposure.</li>
                        <li>Trapped Radiation: Particles captured by Earth’s magnetic field in the Van Allen belts, relevant primarily for LEO missions.</li>

            <div class="subheader" >Types of Radiation in Space</div>
           <div class="infoBox">
            Space radiation comprises ionizing particles from sources inside and outside the solar system. Two primary sources are galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs, or solar particle events), which deliver streams of protons, heavy ions, and other high-energy particles. In addition, space exposes systems and organisms to gamma rays, a highly penetrating electromagnetic form of ionizing radiation.High-charge and high energy (HZE) ions—heavy atomic nuclei like iron or silicon—also figure significantly in the space radiation field.At NASA’s NSRL (NASA Space Radiation Laboratory), researchers generate beams of protons and heavy ions to simulate cosmic radiation and study its effects on biological tissues and electronic systems.

        <div id="3"class="infoContainer">
            <div class="subheader" >Radiation Effects on the Human Body</div>
           <div class="infoBox">
            Ionizing space radiation encountered in missions can damage DNA, causing strand breaks or mutations, which may lead to cancer or altered cell behavior. High‐LET (linear energy transfer) particles—such as heavy ions—can leave lasting imprints on the epigenome and influence sites tied to lung cancer risk. Experiments captured in OSDR data (e.g. OSD-71) show that even moderate dose exposures (0.3–3.0 Gy) elicit cellular responses within hours, including in bystander (non-irradiated) cells. Thus, radiation in space can initiate both direct and indirect effects across tissues, raising risks for genomic instability and disease.

        <div id="4"class="infoContainer">
            <div class="subheader" >Radiation Effects on Cells & Microbes</div>
            <div class="infoBox">
              Ionizing radiation in space can damage DNA and disrupt the DNA damage response (DDR) in individual cells, potentially leading to mutations or failed repair mechanisms. In microbial communities aboard spacecraft (such as on the ISS), exposure to spaceflight conditions including radiation tends to cause minimal changes in microbial diversity over time, indicating some resilience or adaptation in microbial populations. However, microbes in these settings are still subject to cumulative radiation stress along with microgravity effects, necessitating further study of how radiation influences microbial growth rates, mutation accumulation, and community dynamics in space.

        <div id="5"class="infoContainer">
            <div class="subheader" >Radiation & Plants</div>
           <div class="infoBox">
              Space radiation can impose oxidative damage, DNA strand breaks, and transcriptional stress on plants, provoking a robust transcriptional response inclusive of DNA repair and protective pathways. In experiments such as OSD-658, researchers aim to characterize how plant seeds and seedlings respond to chronic low-dose ionizing radiation in space to support crop growth on long missions. Studies also show that plants exposed to gamma irradiation stimulate transcripts involved in homologous recombination and stress response. Over multiple generations, Arabidopsis plants subjected to low but continuous space radiation exhibit molecular adaptations detectable in genome and transcriptional profiles.

        <div id="6"class="infoContainer">
            <div class="subheader" >Shielding & Countermeasures</div>
            <div class="infoBox">
              To protect astronauts and equipment from penetrating ionizing radiation, shielding strategies focus on using materials and configurations that reduce dose—for example, placing detector systems behind aluminum or composite shields (as in the ALTEA project on the ISS) to evaluate shielding effectiveness against heavy ions. Because neutrons, being uncharged, can penetrate more deeply and are harder to block, designs must account for indirect ionizations and secondary particle production when selecting shielding materials. Additionally, biological countermeasures are under investigation—such as miRNA-based interventions to mitigate tissue degeneration caused by HZE (high-charge, high-energy) radiation exposure.

            comprehensive omics and spaceflight datasets, and Gene Lab, which links these datasets to dosimetry for studying chronic low-dose, HZE radiation effects Research gaps include limited understanding of long-term low-dose effects, the combined impact of microgravity and radiation on biological systems, and the need to identify genetic and metabolic pathways for developing personalized countermeasures. Addressing these is critical for astronaut health and safety on extended missions.
