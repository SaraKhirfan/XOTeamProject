      content="Enable a new era of human space exploration! NASA has been performing biology experiments in space for decades, generating a tremendous amount of information that will need to be considered as humans prepare to revisit the Moon and explore Mars. Although this knowledge is publicly available, it can be difficult for potential users to find information that pertains to their specific interests. Your challenge is to build a dynamic dashboard that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge graphs, and/or other tools to summarize a set of NASA bioscience publications and enables users to explore the impacts and results of the experiments these publications describe."

        <h3>Space - Grown Plant</h3>
        <p>In microgravity, plants experience a fundamentally altered growth environment. Without a strong gravity vector, roots lose consistent orientation cues, often growing in random directions, while stems and leaves may not align as predictably toward light. Water and nutrient distribution becomes irregular, requiring engineered systems such as hydroponics, capillary-based delivery, and controlled LED lighting. Studies aboard the ISS with Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) reveal changes in gene expression, cell wall structure, and hormone signaling, affecting growth rate, leaf morphology, and flowering time. Some plants exhibit stress responses linked to altered fluid transport and reduced mechanical load. Despite these challenges, experiments have demonstrated successful cultivation of lettuce, mustard greens, zinnias, and wheat in orbit, providing critical insight into sustaining crews on long-duration missions. Space-grown plants not only produce food but also contribute to oxygen regeneration, CO₂ absorption, and psychological support for astronauts, underscoring their role in closed-loop life support systems for lunar and Martian habitats.

        <h3>Earth - Grown Plant</h3>
<p>On Earth, plant growth is strongly directed by gravity, light, water, and nutrient availability. Roots grow downward through positive gravitropism, stems orient upward through negative gravitropism and phototropism, and leaves position themselves to maximize photosynthesis. Flowering, seed set, and germination follow predictable developmental timelines, providing stable baselines for comparison.
Soil and substrate systems ensure reliable nutrient delivery, pH buffering, and microbial interactions that support plant health. Water transport is governed by gravity, capillarity, and transpiration, while light cycles (natural or controlled) regulate developmental programs.
In space research, Earth-grown “control plants” are essential for comparison with microgravity experiments. NASA maintains parallel ground controls in facilities like Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH), enabling analysis of growth rate, morphology, gene expression, and nutritional content against Earth standards.

  <h1>Why Plants Matter in Space?</h1>
  <div class="sections fade-in">
    <p>Experiment Plant Habitat-07 (PH-07) focuses on the growth of Lactuca sativa (lettuce) aboard the International Space Station’s Advanced Plant Habitat during the 2024–2025 mission. The study investigates how water stress influences lettuce growth, root structure, and microbiome interactions under microgravity conditions. The outcomes are expected to provide critical insights for developing sustainable space crop production systems, which will play a key role in supporting long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.</p>

<p>The Human Hematopoietic Stem Cell Aging Study investigated human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as part of the ISS Research Program. Conducted between 2021 and 2023, with results published in 2025, the study revealed that spaceflight conditions lead to accelerated aging in blood-forming stem cells. Researchers observed increased DNA damage, impaired mitochondrial function, and a reduction in the cells’ regenerative potential, highlighting important health risks for astronauts on long-duration missions and informing strategies to protect human health in space.</p>

<p>The GEARS (Genomic Enumeration of Antibiotic Resistance in Space) experiment, launched in 2024 and currently active, studies microbial communities aboard the ISS. Its primary goal is to sequence microbial DNA to detect and track antibiotic resistance genes in the space station’s closed environment. By analyzing how microbes adapt and potentially become resistant, the research provides vital insights into astronaut health risks and supports the development of effective countermeasures for maintaining safe living conditions during long-term space missions.</p>

<p>The BioSentinel experiment, launched on November 16, 2022 aboard the Artemis I Deep Space Exploration mission and extended into 2025, investigates the effects of deep space radiation using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) alongside specialized radiation dosimetry devices. The study measures yeast’s biological responses to different radiation types and doses beyond Earth’s protective magnetic field. Its findings are crucial for characterizing radiation risks in deep space and will provide essential data to support the safety and health of astronauts during future Moon and Mars missions.</p>
